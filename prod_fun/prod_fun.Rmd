# Overview

### Overview

- **What's the question?** Does more trade increase income?
- **Why does it matter?** Economist tend to assume yes, but it's challeging to identify direction of causality empirically.
- **What's the contribution?** Author generates a time-varying geographic instrument to solve for omitted variable bias of previous attempts, and identifies a positive causality effect of trade on income.
- **How do they do it?**  Identification comes from the shift over time from sea to air transportation. Country pairs benefit differently from this shift.

# Introduction

### Introduction

- Though wealthier countries trade more than poorer ones, it is difficult to assess the *direction of causality*. 
- Frankel and Romer (1999) use the distance between countries to predict bilateral trade.
- However, time-invariant geographic instrumenst are susceptible to *omitted variable bias* (e.g. coutries nearer the equator have longer trade routes and might have lower income due to uproductive colonial institutions)(Rodriguez and Rodrik, 2001).

### Introduction

> **Key idea:** Effictive distances around the globe **change over time** as they are determined by the inteaction between physical geography and transportation technology.

- In particular, the drop in **air freight transportation** costs have led to a substantial shift to this mode of shipping.

### Introduction

> **Key insight:** Improvements in technology of air transport have differential consecuences for different countries.


For example:

- Japan $\longleftrightarrow$ Germany:
    - Sea: 12,000 > Air: 5,000 nautical miles
- US $\longleftrightarrow$ Germany:
    - Sea $\approx$ Air
    
### Contribution

- Gravity equations that include both **air and sea distances** are used to create time-series predictions for bilateral trade.
- These predictions are used as **instruments in a panel regression** of trade on income to control for country fixed effects.
- This estimates are **less likely to be biased** by omitted variables.

# Framework

### Framework | Goal: impact of trade on GDP

$$
ln(y_{it})= \gamma_i+\gamma_t+\beta\times ln(trade_{it})+\epsilon_{it} \qquad \text{(1)}
$$

where:

- $y_{it}$: real GDP per capita
- $\gamma_i$ and $\gamma_y$ country and time fixed effects
- $trade_{it}$ us the sum of imports and exports for contry *i* at time *t*

**OLS** of (1) would not be identified because of reverse causality
**IV** strategy is employed: estimating trade using gravity equations in first stage

# Gravity model estimation

### Gravity model estimation {#grav}

Anserson and van Wincoop (2003):

$$
trade_{ijt} = \frac{y_{it}y_{jt}}{y_{wt}} \left( \frac{\tau_{ijt}}{P_{it}P_{jt}} \right)^{1-\sigma}
$$

- $trade_{ijt}$: bilateral trade between country *i* and country *j* at time *t*
- $y_{it}$, $y_{jt}$ and $y_{wt}$: incomes
- $P_{it}$ and $P_{jt}$: country-specific multilateral resistance terms

### Gravity model estimation

In estimations:

$$\begin{aligned}
ln(trade_{ijt})&=\alpha + \gamma_{i} + \gamma_j + \gamma_t + \beta_{sea,t}\times ln(seadist_{ij}) \qquad \text{(2)} \\
&+ \beta_{air,t}\times ln(airdist_{ij}) + \beta \boldsymbol{X}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijt}
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
ln(trade_{ijt})&=\alpha + \gamma_{ij} + \gamma_t + \beta_{sea,t}\times ln(seadist_{ij}) \qquad \text{(3)} \\
&+ \beta_{air,t}\times ln(airdist_{ij}) +  \epsilon_{ijt}
\end{aligned}$$

- *P* and *y* terms are controlled using dummy countries
-  Time effects control for common rates of growth. Idiosyncratic growth rate differences will go to error term. Second stage will control for these effects
- $\tau_{ijt} =f_t(airdist_{ij},seadist_{ij})$
- Predicted values are aggregated and used as instrument in second stage

# Data

### Data {#dat}

- **Trade:** Glick and Taylor (2010) from IMF Direction of Trade

- **Air distance:** CEPII's population-weighted great circle distance

- **Sea distance:** Author's own estimations using gridded geographic data from CIESIN

### Results summary

- $\beta_{iv}$ > $\beta_{OLS}$, no statistically significant though. Overlap with previous estimates (Franker and Romer, 1999)

- First stage *F*-statistic over 15 in all cases

- Full gravity instrument can predict **17 percent** of variation in growth rates

- **R^2 are unusually high** (!)

# Conclusions

### Conclusions

- Paper introduces idea that **effective distance changes over time** as is determined by technology changes in transportation

- These changes are exploited to identify **causality effect** of trade on income

- Trade has a **positive** impact on output

- Changes in trade account for **17 percent of variation** in growth rates across countries between 1960 and 1995

### Instrument {#inst}

Bilateral trade predictions take the form

$$
ln(trade_{it}) = f_t(\boldsymbol{X}_{ij},\boldsymbol{X}_i,\boldsymbol{X}_j)
$$
where:

- $\boldsymbol{X}_{ij}$: time-invariant pair characteristics
- $\boldsymbol{X}_{i}$ and $\boldsymbol{X}_{j}$: time-invariant individual country characteristics

### Instrument

Fixed country effecs in second step implies we can drop $\boldsymbol{X}_{i}$. Also, a functional form for $f_t(\cdot)$ is the following:

$$
ln(trade_{ijt})= \boldsymbol{X}_j + \beta_{sea,t}\times ln(seadist_{ij})+\beta_{air,t}\times ln(airdist_{ij})
$$

- $\beta$'s: time changing weights on the two measures that vary according to technology changes
- $\boldsymbol{X}_j$: scales the time-variant distance relationship with time-invariant characteristics of the partner

### Caveats {#cav}

- Exclusion restrictions: Increases in the movement of people generating increases in GDP $\implies$ Reduced form regressions can be interpreted as general effects of globalization

- LATE: Heterogeneous gains from air shipping. Countries that take advantage of air travel have more to gain than countries that do not. Instrument $\implies$ LATE of the countries that embrace air freight
